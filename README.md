This is a users API which handles Registery, Login, Roles routes, and logging out.
I used Authentication and added security for this project using bCrypt to hash the password and compare it. and JWT to generate access tokens and refresh tokens when a client logs in, and ensuring the client is logged in with a real valid token and a non-expired token.

Languages and dependencies, db used:
-Node.js
-PostgreSQL
-Express.js
-Prisma ORM
-jsonwebtoken
-bcrypt
-prisma Client
